This repository contains four separate animations/visuals that were originally coded in Processing:
1. bullseye creates a visual with concentric circles of alternating colors.
2. In dot_race, a user clicks, and the two dots move forward at random paces. The code stops when one dot reaches the end of the window.
3. rain_game is an interactive program where the user uses the mouse to control a black "bucket" to catch blue "raindrops." They earn a 
point with each raindrop caught and lose a point with each raindrop lost. The program ends when the user earns 50 points.
4. ring_mirage is an animation using similar code to bullseye. Two circles with several smaller concentric circles move toward each other,
creating an optical illusion.
